# Simple Python Calculator
This is a beginner-friendly command-line calculator built with Python. It asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation, then performs the calculation and displays the result.

---

## Features
- Supports four basic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid operations
- Prevents division by zero

---

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The first number e.g `10`
   - The second number e.g `5`
   - An operation symbol (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) e.g `+`
2. The program calculates and displays the result in the format:
`10.0` + `5.0` = `15.0`


---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No external libraries needed

---

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named calculator.py

2. Open your terminal or command prompt

3. Run the program using:
python calculator.py

## Example Usage

```bash
python calculator.py
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 4
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): *
12.0 * 4.0 = 48.0
```

## Possible Improvements
- Adding support for more operations (e.g. modulus, exponentiation)

- Looping the program to allow multiple calculations

- Using try/except for input validation

- Creating a graphical version using Tkinter
